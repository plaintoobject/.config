## Week 1: Foundations
**Days 1-3:** Start with the official Rust Book (chapters 1-6). Set up your environment and get comfortable with basic syntax, ownership, and borrowing concepts. These are Rust's unique features that you must understand.

**Days 4-7:** Complete chapters 7-10 of the Rust Book covering modules, collections, error handling, and generics. Start doing small coding exercises on Exercism or Rustlings to reinforce concepts.

## Week 2: Core Concepts
**Days 8-10:** Deep dive into lifetimes, traits, and pattern matching. These are where many newcomers struggle, so spend extra time here.

**Days 11-14:** Learn about iterators, closures, and smart pointers (Box, Rc, RefCell). Practice with more complex Exercism problems.

## Week 3: Practical Application
**Days 15-18:** Build your first real project - a command-line tool like a file organizer, text processor, or simple HTTP client using libraries like `clap` for CLI parsing and `reqwest` for HTTP.

**Days 19-21:** Explore the ecosystem: cargo, crates.io, common libraries (serde for serialization, tokio for async). Add features to your CLI tool.

## Week 4: Advanced Topics & Polish
**Days 22-24:** Learn async programming basics with tokio, or dive into systems programming concepts like unsafe code (but use sparingly).

**Days 25-28:** Start a second project in a different domain - maybe a web API with axum/warp, a simple game, or data processing tool. Focus on code organization and testing.

## Key Success Strategies:
- **Code daily** - even 1-2 hours consistently beats marathon sessions
- **Embrace the compiler** - Rust's error messages are excellent teachers
- **Join the community** - Rust Discord, Reddit r/rust, and forums are very helpful
- **Focus on ownership first** - this is Rust's biggest hurdle but also its superpower
- **Use clippy** and rustfmt from day one for good habits

## Essential Resources:
- The Rust Programming Language (official book)
- Rustlings (interactive exercises)
- Rust by Example for quick references
- Exercism for structured practice
