# Azis's Current Workflow

Look, this is my current configuration workflow. I’ll keep updating this repo gradually as I make changes or experiment with new setups. Nothing here is final—think of it as a living workspace that keeps evolving as I learn and refine my tools.

If you’re curious about how I organize things, feel free to dive in and explore. You might find some useful snippets or ideas you can adapt for your own setup. On the flip side, if you see something that could be improved, I’d love to hear about it.

You can star, clone, or fork this repo anytime. That way, if I push updates in the future, you’ll be able to keep in sync, raise issues, or even drop your own contributions.
